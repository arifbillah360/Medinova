					<p>Care embodies the concern, compassion, and sensitivity with which we care for patients as individuals on a one-to-one basis. It depicts our way of dealing with patients, clients, colleagues and co-workers. Many times, it is thought of as a bedside behavior, but it also belongs in business offices, cafeterias and boardrooms.</p>
